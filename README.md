- 👋 Hi, I’m @simoneBesh
- 👀 I’m 13 years old and am currently learning Javascript and HTML! I have created some basic web games, and am now experimenting with website and front end stuff. 
- 🌱 Other than that, I am interested in learning new things, reading all kinds of books, playing piano and furthering my knowledge!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more from everyone here and hopefully improve my skills!
